When [Empty Space CIC](https://www.emptyspacecic.com/) needed templates to help speed up their amazing artwork, Wye Make stepped in to help!

### From empty space to creative place 
 
Living Windows is a community art programme, breathing life into forgotten high street spaces through volunteer-led art projects. Temporarily transforming empty buildings and retail shops by hand-painting scenes onto their windows and walls, their volunteers have transformed Monmouth High Street and the surrounding areas into a festival of colour, but writing all those signs out by hand is slow and painstaking, even if you're a professional sign writer!

Living Windows approached Wye Make to see if we could help by providing templates for some of their signs, and we were only too glad to step in!

> "Using the plastic templates that Wye Make have made us means that anyone can now create the signs instead of it falling to just one person!" - Someone from Living Windows, probably

### Throwing shade and cutting shapes

Thankfully, we had just the tool for the job!  We were able to purchase our [Silhouette Cameo 4](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/cameo-4) craft cutter a few years ago thanks to a grant from [Monmouth Town Council](https://www.monmouth.gov.uk/).

It's able to cut through anything from paper and card to vinyl and thin wood, so we know it would be up to the task!

We showed the team from Living Windows CIC how to create their designs on a tablet or laptop and send them over to the Silhouette, which then cut them out of thin acetate sheets.

These sheets could then be taped onto the window or wall and painted through to leave the picture or text in exactly the right place.

### The end result

Living Windows are now coming back to Wye Make on a regular basis to use the Silhouette and create more stencils for their designs.

The recent purchase of an iron and ironing board also means we can start transfering images from the Silhouette onto bags, t-shirts, and other items so anyone can create their own merch!
